SpaceEngineersScripts
---------------------

This is a collection of C# scripts that I have made and work on for Space Engineers. I thought it would be better to use a Github then the workshop, since it'll be easier for me to work on and use version control then that. Bleck.

These projects can be minified (if needed or wanted) using one of these tools:
    * https://codebeautify.org/csharpviewer
    * https://github.com/atifaziz/CSharpMinifier

Projects so far:
    * [Miner Manager](MinerManager)
